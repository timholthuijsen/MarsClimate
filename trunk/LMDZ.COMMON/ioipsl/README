Scripts in this directory are illustrative examples of how to
download and install IOIPSL, e.g.:
1) install_ioipsl_occigen.bash: everything is set for Occigen, just run:
./install_ioipsl_occigen.bash
And output modules and library will be in ../../IOIPSL
(with links in 'modipsl/lib' and 'modipsl/bin' for backward compatibility)

2) install_ioipsl_gfortran.bash, and install_ioipsl_pgf90.bash and
install_ioipsl_ifort.bash are more general examples
for installing IOIPSL on a machine with these compilers.
For these you might need to ajust the location of the NetCDF library
(see the NETCDF_HOME variable in the script)
And you will need to set up arch files (which should match those
of the GCM) to adequately compile the library

Note that it is a good idea to install IOIPSL alongside LMDZ
so that its version can be tracked (and potentialy updated), as it is
downloaded from a different svn repository.
